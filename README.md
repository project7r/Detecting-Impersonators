# Detecting-Impersonators In Examination Centres


Detecting impersonators in examination centres is important to provide a better way of
examination handling system which can help in reducing malpractices happening in examination
centers. According to the latest news reports, 56 JEE candidates who are potential
impersonators were detected by a national testing agency. In order to solve this problem, an
effective method is required with less manpower. With the advancement of machine learning
and AI technology, it is easy to solve this problem. In this project we are developing an AI
system where images of students are collected with names and hall ticket numbers are pre-CMRtrained using the KDTree algorithm and the model is saved. Whenever a student enters into
classroom, the student should look at the camera and enter class, after the given time or class is
filled with studentâ€™s information will store in a video file with student name and hall ticket no . The video will have a user with hall ticket no and name on each face. If admin finds any
unknown user tag on face admin can recheck and trace impersonators.
